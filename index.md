# Hello World

Hi, my name is Aidan Dao, I am a student at [Cal. State Univ. of Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and I am a Computer Science Major.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1, was based on parking rules. Parking rules were described for these given streets: Ash, Beach, Cedar, and Date; each street having rules for differing days and times. This lab was designed for students to get used to making if, if else, and else statements as well as boolean expressions. It was interesting to see how such easy rules to read and understand, actually took quite a bit of programming to do. I practiced using functions, if statements, boolean expressions, and a switch statement to check which function to check. 

* Lab 9 
    Lab 9, part 1, was programming a file reader and running it through a spellchecker function. In this lab I worked on my technical skills, such as: ifstream, file to file comparison via vectors, vector manipulation, and general use of functions. It was challenging to understand the idea of files interacting with each other at first, but in the end I got the hang of it and really enjoyed this lab. 

* Lab 11 (part 1)
    Lab 11, part 1, was our first lab using Class functions. If these are my top three labs, this lab was number one. Being able to modify, and use, a Class function was challenging. It was just new and not intuitive for me at first. Working on this lab made me feel more comfortable with Class functions, as well as making me excited for what lies ahead in my computer science career. In this lab I worked on these technical skills: Class function private and public usage as well as defining, ifstream, and Class vector manipulation.
